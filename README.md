TECH STACK : HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT (D3,JQUERY AND WAYPOINT)

1. I have assumed that the house ownership rates in every ethnic group in constant over the years, 
which results in the discrepancy in the visualization ( house ownership visualization) at the end.
( I have written the text of the values provided in the sheet though). This can be easily rectified, 
if the right ownership rates are put in place for every ethnic group. 

2. Also,I think it is important to highlight individual ethnic groups contribution in the count 
of population who dont own a house at the end to conclude the story. Again this can be done 
achieved easily if we know the ownership percentage/ethnic groups changes over the years.
